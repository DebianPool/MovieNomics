I. Intro

The application of Data Science and Economics to movies. 

The true goal isn't to uncover any unknown insight into movies themselves or 
the industry. As I am in no position to take action items upon such knowledge.
Rather, its simply a topic of interest for testing code and programs. 

Primarily in the field of Data Science where SQL, R, Python, and Java Script are tools 
which demand constant practice for their application in Data Architecture, Data Analysis
and Data Visualization.

Secondarily, if Economic theory can be applied for insight and contribution to those 
communities that would potentially be beneficial. At the moment, the practice and 
application of Data Science appears to be far ahead of any theoretical underpinnings.

II. Data

We are starting with horror movies. There are several reasons that this genre is attractive.

1. History
	a. It has been around for decades 
	b. Through time has remained consistent.
		i. The genre in the 1960's and 1970's is more or less the same as genre in 1990's and		     2000's.
		ii. As opposed to action movies which may have started in Western settings and were 
		transported to suburban and urban settings
2. Economic Model
	a. Adopts Franchising practices early
	b. Seems like the genre invented Sequelitis. This gives data points

3. Future
	a. Unlike Westerns, Musicals, Superhero, etc are potentially fad genres with huge ebbs and flows. Holidays come every year.
	b. Unlike Christmas movies, horror movies exploit brand, so analysis is simpler.
