Application of Data Science and Economics to movies. 

The true goal isn't to uncover any unknown insight into movies themselves or 
the industry. As I am in no position to take action items upon such knowledge.
Rather, its simply a topic of interest for testing code and programs. 

Primarily in the field of Data Science where SQL, R, Python, and Java Script are tools 
which demand constant practice for their application in Data Architecture, Data Analysis
and Data Visualization.

Secondarily, if Economic theory can be applied for insight and contribution to those 
communities that would potentially be beneficial. At the moment, the practice and 
application of Data Science appears to be far ahead of any theoretical underpinnings.
